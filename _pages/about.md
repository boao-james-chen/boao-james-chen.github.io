Hi there! I am a PhD student at the Michtom School of Computer Science, [Brandeis University](https://www.brandeis.edu/computer-science/), working under the mentorship of Prof.[Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). My research interest are broadly in tuning and optimizing large scale data systems, with a current focus on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees. Prior to joining Brandeis, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science from [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/).
