Hi there! I am a first year PhD student at the Michtom School of Computer Science, Brandeis University, working under the mentorship of Prof.[Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). My research interest are broadly leveraging machine learning to solve large-scale data management challenges. Prior to joining Brandeis, I completed my M.Eng and undergraduate studies in Computer Science from Cornell University where I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/) and Prof. [Cheng Zhang](https://czhang.org/).
