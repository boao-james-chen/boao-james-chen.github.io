👋 ▫️ 👍 👀 ❕

Hi there! I am a first year PhD student at the Michtom School of Computer Science, Brandeis University, working under the mentorship of Prof.[Subhadeep Sarkar](https://subhadeep.net/). I had the pleasure of working on 

 Prior to joining Brandeis, I completed my M.Eng and undergraduate studies in Computer science from Cornell University where I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sainyam Galhotra](https://sainyamgalhotra.com/) and Prof. [Cheng Zhang](https://czhang.org/).  

My research interests are broadly learning robust user representations, and aligning machine to human reasoning. I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website), Prof. [Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io), and Prof. [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) at Cornell. Currently, I study reinforcement learning and human-in-loop dynamical systems. Sample-efficient [low-rank representation learning](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/lowrank-representation-deep-learning-recsys) for dynamical and unobserved user states, computationally-efficient [weighted logistic bandits](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/weighted-logistic-bandit), and "algorithm-of-thoughts" styled [personalized question-understanding system](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/wise-person) are examples of what I am working on.
