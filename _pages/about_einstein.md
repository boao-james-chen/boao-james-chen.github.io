Learning is key for any type of intelligence. I love thinking about how human learns, and whether that is transferable to machines. Questions like `Why ML requires more data than human?`intrigue me.

My research interests are broadly learning robust user representations, and aligning machine to human reasoning. I'm fortunate to be working with Prof. [Sarah Dean](https://sdean.website), Prof. [Wen Sun](https://wensun.github.io), and Prof. [Thorsten Joachims](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/) at Cornell. Currently, I study reinforcement learning and human-in-loop dynamical systems. Sample-efficient [low-rank representation learning](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/lowrank-representation-deep-learning-recsys) for dynamical and unobserved user states, computationally-efficient [weighted logistic bandits](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/weighted-logistic-bandit), and "algorithm-of-thoughts" styled [personalized question-understanding system](https://github.com/DaiYijia02/wise-person) are examples of what I am working on.
